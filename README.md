# Sorting Ducks
[Head First C#](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books//hfcsharp/)

&nbsp;
## 00 Start the project
* In VS, create a Console Application project.

&nbsp;
## 01 Add the Duck class
* Add the Duck class and the KindOfDuck enum.

&nbsp;
## 02 Initialize a List of ducks
* Initialize a List of six ducks.

&nbsp;
## 03 Implement IComparable<Duck>
* Update Duck class by implementing IComparable<Duck> so that it can sort itself based on duck size.

&nbsp;
## 04 Use IComparer to sort by size
* Sort using IComparer<T>. A new instance of the class that implements it has to be created.

&nbsp;
## 05 Use IComparer to sort by kind
* Compare the ducksâ€™ Kind properties, so the ducks are sorted based on the index value of the Kind property, a KindOfDuck enum.
